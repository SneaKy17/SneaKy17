# Hi there, I'm Nikhil (aka SneaKy17) 👋

👋 Hi, I'm Nikhil Saklani — a Python Developer and Data Science learner passionate about building real-world projects. I explore ML models, automate workflows, and visualize data using Pandas, NumPy, and Tableau. Currently participating in Google Tunix and AI Agent challenges. Let’s connect and build something impactful!

---

## 🔭 Current Focus
- Hinata AI Assistant (natural language interaction + modular skills)
- Improving structure in Portfolio Projects (readability, reusability, docs)
- Strengthening fundamentals: async patterns, clean code, testing

## 🧰 Tech & Tools
Languages: Python · TypeScript · (learning) HTML/CSS
Tools & Concepts: GitHub Actions · REST APIs · Prompt Engineering · Modular Architecture · Automation

## 📌 Featured / To Pin
| Project | Description | Stack | Status |
|---------|-------------|-------|--------|
| Hinata-AI-Assistant | Personal AI assistant experiments | Python | Active / Evolving |
| Portfolio-Projects | Collection of learning & showcase builds | Mixed (TS/Py) | Ongoing |
| (Future Starter) | Planned template repo (backend or bot) | TBD | Coming Soon |

## 🧪 Learning Log
- Built conversational flows & intent handling for an assistant
- Iterated on project organization (separating logic from config)
- Practiced writing clearer commit messages & small PR-sized changes

## 🚀 Roadmap
- Add CONTRIBUTING and project documentation
- Introduce simple test suites (Pytest / Jest)
- Add workflow for lint + test (GitHub Actions)
- Refactor AI assistant modules for extensibility

## 🤝 Collaboration
Open to small contributions, feedback, or pairing on:
- Assistant features / command modules
- Repository cleanup & automation
- Lightweight dev tools / scripts
